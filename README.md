# :joystick: Codename 7 :joystick:
-> Codename 7 is a simple space shooter game developed by me

-> All the assets used in the creation of this game can be found on https://opengameart.org/


# :rocket: Controls :rocket:
-> You control your spaceship with the arrow keys of your keyboard, and also, you shoot the other enemies with the space bar


# :flying_saucer: Enemies :flying_saucer:
-> You have 3 types of enemies, the meteorites, the Gunners, and the Kamikazes.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Gunners: They are the only enemies that can shoot projectiles at you, they also give you 100 points if killed

Meteorites: they are the easiest enemies to kill in the game, one hit and you basically destroy them, they also give you only 5 points when killed

Kamikazes: those are the hardest enemies in the game, you can't kill them, you can only try to avoid them, if a kamikaze ship hits you, you are essencially dead,
they also make a noisy sound when they spawn.
